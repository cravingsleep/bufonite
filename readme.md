# Bufonite

A neovim plugin that simplifies buffer navigation and display.

## TODO

- Store buffer info in the MRU itself?
- What happens if there is more buffers than height
- What happens if you have more buffers than sneak keys?
- Adjustable UI size
- Better looking UI?
- modes? open and delete?
- split opening
